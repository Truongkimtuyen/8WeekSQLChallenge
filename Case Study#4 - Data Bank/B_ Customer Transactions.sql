select txn_type,
		count(*) as total_transaction,
		sum(txn_amount) as total_amount
from customer_transactions
group by txn_type
order by txn_type

Result:
|txn_type    |	total_transaction    |	total_amount |
|  ------    |         ------        |     ------    |
| deposit    |		2671	     |	  1359168    |

--2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?
with cte as (		select customer_id,
						 txn_type,
				        count(*) as total_transaction,
						sum(txn_amount) as total_amount
				from customer_transactions
				where txn_type='deposit'
				group by customer_id,txn_type
				)
select  txn_type,
		avg(total_transaction) as avg_transaction,
		avg(total_amount) as avg_amount
from cte
group by  txn_type

Result:
| txn_type   | avg_transaction	| avg_amount |
|  ------    |       ------     |   ------   | 
|  deposit   |		5	|     2718   |

--3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?
with cte as (select customer_id,
			   DATEPART(month,txn_date) as month_id,
			   DATENAME(MONTH,txn_date) as month_name,
			   sum(case when txn_type ='deposit' then 1
					else null end) as deposit_count,
				sum(case when txn_type ='purchase' then 1
					else null end) as purchase_count,
				sum(case when txn_type='withdrawal' then 1
					else null end) as withdrawal_count
		from customer_transactions
		group by customer_id,
			   DATEPART(month,txn_date),
			   DATENAME(MONTH,txn_date) 
		)
select  month_id,
		month_name,
		count(*) as total_customer
from cte
where (deposit_count >1 and purchase_count >=1) or (deposit_count >1 and withdrawal_count  >=1) 
group by  month_id,
	 month_name
order by month_id

Result:
|month_id    |    month_name	|  total_customer  |
|  ------    |       ------     |      ------      |
|	1    |	   January	|	168	   |

--4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?
with cte as( select		customer_id,
						DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, txn_date), 0) as start_of_month,
						sum(case when txn_type='deposit' then txn_amount
							else -1* txn_amount end) as total_amount
				from customer_transactions
				group by customer_id,DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, txn_date), 0)
				--order by customer_id
				)
select 
	 customer_id,
	DATEPART(month,start_of_month) as month_id,
	DATENAME(month,start_of_month) as month_name,
   sum(total_amount) over(partition by customer_id order by start_of_month) as closing_balance
		
from cte 
group by customer_id,DATEPART(month,start_of_month),
	                 DATENAME(month,start_of_month),total_amount,start_of_month
order by customer_id

Result:
|customer_id |	  month_id   |	month_name  | closing_balance  |
|  ------    |    ------     |   ------     |       ------     |
|	1    |	    1	     |	 January    |	     312       |
